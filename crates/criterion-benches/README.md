Benchmark results are hosted here: <https://bluurryy.github.io/bump-scope/criterion/report/>.

However I would recommend the [../callgrind-benches](../callgrind-benches) since I wasn't able to get consistent time-based benchmark results. The results linked above are not to be trusted. Some individual cases may be over 20% slower than they should be.
