error[E0597]: `s` does not live long enough

   | `s` dropped here while still borrowed
   | borrow might be used here, when `v` is dropped and runs the destructor for type `MutBumpVec<PrintOnDrop<&String>, &mut Bump>`

   = note: values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are defined
