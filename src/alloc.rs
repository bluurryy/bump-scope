//! Memory allocation APIs.
//!
//! This crate's [`Allocator`], [`AllocError`] and [`Global`] resemble the types and traits from
//! the nightly allocator api of the standard library (3528a5b 2025-05-11).
//!
//! `bump-scope` provides compatibility with the allocator api's of
//! - the nightly standard library via the feature `nightly-allocator-api`
//! - `allocator_api2` version 0.2 via the feature `allocator-api2-02`
//! - `allocator_api2` version 0.3 via the feature `allocator-api2-03`
//!
//! `Bump` and `Bump(Scope)` will implement those foreign `Allocator` traits when the respective feature is enabled.
//! You can also use implementors of their `Allocator` trait as base allocators via the [compat] wrapper types.
//!
//! You can convert between this crate's `AllocError` and foreign one's via the `From` and `Into` traits.

/// An implementation of `Allocator` can allocate, grow, shrink, and deallocate arbitrary blocks of
/// data described via [`Layout`][].
///
/// `Allocator` is designed to be implemented on ZSTs, references, or smart pointers.
/// An allocator for `MyAlloc([u8; N])` cannot be moved, without updating the pointers to the
/// allocated memory.
///
/// In contrast to [`GlobalAlloc`][alloc_crate::alloc::GlobalAlloc], `Allocator` allows zero-sized allocations. If an underlying
/// allocator does not support this (like jemalloc) or responds by returning a null pointer
/// (such as `libc::malloc`), this must be caught by the implementation.
///
/// ### Currently allocated memory
///
/// Some of the methods require that a memory block is *currently allocated* by an allocator.
/// This means that:
///  * the starting address for that memory block was previously
///    returned by [`allocate`], [`grow`], or [`shrink`], and
///  * the memory block has not subsequently been deallocated.
///
/// A memory block is deallocated by a call to [`deallocate`],
/// or by a call to [`grow`] or [`shrink`] that returns `Ok`.
/// A call to `grow` or `shrink` that returns `Err`,
/// does not deallocate the memory block passed to it.
///
/// [`allocate`]: Allocator::allocate
/// [`grow`]: Allocator::grow
/// [`shrink`]: Allocator::shrink
/// [`deallocate`]: Allocator::deallocate
///
/// ### Memory fitting
///
/// Some of the methods require that a `layout` *fit* a memory block or vice versa. This means that the
/// following conditions must hold:
///  * the memory block must be *currently allocated* with alignment of [`layout.align()`], and
///  * [`layout.size()`] must fall in the range `min ..= max`, where:
///    - `min` is the size of the layout used to allocate the block, and
///    - `max` is the actual size returned from [`allocate`], [`grow`], or [`shrink`].
///
/// [`layout.align()`]: Layout::align
/// [`layout.size()`]: Layout::size
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Memory blocks that are [*currently allocated*] by an allocator,
/// must point to valid memory, and retain their validity while until either:
///  - the memory block is deallocated, or
///  - the allocator is dropped.
///
/// Copying, cloning, or moving the allocator must not invalidate memory blocks returned from it.
/// A copied or cloned allocator must behave like the original allocator.
///
/// A memory block which is [*currently allocated*] may be passed to
/// any method of the allocator that accepts such an argument.

    /// not have its contents initialized.
